## About

This project is a submodule for NRE-AI. Its main purpose is to process data of cities.
Processed data will then be used by NRE and NRE-AI.
It will simulate how selling and buying commodieties will affect citeis (its resources and prices).

Also the AI mentioned in NRE-AI will learn from this script on dummy data, so it will work seemless with NRE itself.
